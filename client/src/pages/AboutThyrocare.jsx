            Thyrocare is India&apos;s first fully automated diagnostic laboratory with
            a sharp focus on delivering quality at affordable costs to
            laboratories and hospitals in India and beyond. We operate through a
            Central Processing Laboratory (CPL) in Mumbai for esoteric tests and
            Regional Processing Laboratories in major metro cities, ensuring the

            Built on the belief that quality is the heart of intelligent
            management, Thyrocare became one of the first Indian diagnostic
            laboratories to secure ISO 9001-2000 accreditation in 2001 (now
            upgraded to ISO 9001:2015), followed by CAP (College of American
            Pathologists) certification in 2007.
